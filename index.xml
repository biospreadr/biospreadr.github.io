We&amp;rsquo;ve also developed an informative poster and marketing video to present BioSpreadr at the Univeristy of Waterloo final year design project symposium. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the symposium was held virtually this year. Despite this, we still had a great presentation where we were able to show off all the work we have done over the past two terms and to interact with audience members who had questions about BioSpreadr.</description></item><item><title>Cleaning things up</title><link>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-6/</guid><description>Week 8 This week we were focusing on getting each component of BioSpreadr into a more finalized state.
Suction Mechanism We were able to finish the first iteration of the suction mechanism ahead of schedule. This version was working well but to improve the precision and consitency of lifting the lid we added a linear guide. This modification made the mechanism more similar to what a production version of the system would look like.</description></item><item><title>Mechanical Experiments and Carrier Tube Progress</title><link>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-5/</guid><description>Week 7 This week we were able to make great progress on both the Carrier Tube mechanism and on our Mechanical Simulation work.
Mechanical Simulation: Experimenting COVID-19 Considerations Due to the limitations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic our team has had to make significant modifications to our designs which were made with the intent of developing BioSpreadr in an in-person, lab context. This has been the biggest challenge we have faced throughout the term as we have had to make alterations to all components of our project.</description></item><item><title>Suction Mechanism Updates and Progress on Mechanical Simulation</title><link>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-4/</guid><description>Week 6 Suction Mechanism: Updates Construction This past week was the Winter reading week, so we took advantage of the opportunity to make a lot of progress on the suction mechanism.
We were able to get the base construction complete including wiring for the controller, shield, vacuum pump, ultrasonic sensor, and power system. In addition to the base assembly, we integrated a push button to start the process of lifting the dish lid with the suction mechanism and an LED used for error signalling.</description></item><item><title>Starting on the Suction Mechanism and Carrier Tube progress</title><link>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-3/</guid><description>Week 5 Carrier Tube: Electrical Updates This week was a lot of troubleshooting for the work on the carrier tube mechanism. The datasheet for the solenoid indicated that it could operate when supplied 5-6V with 0.8-1A. After testing out various power supplies rated at 5V and 1-1.2A, the carrier tube was still not working as intended. As seen in the following video, the solenoid could only retract when assisted by an external force.</description></item><item><title>More progress on the Carrier Tube Mechanism</title><link>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-2/</guid><description>Week 4 Carrier Tube: Mechanical Updates After getting the initial prints completed last week, this week was spent refining the mechanics of the carrier tube system and testing everything prior to handoff for electrical/software integration. Initial test fits revealed that the solenoid cavity in the 3D printed part was too small to fit the solenoid. There was a similar problem last week with the inner carrier tube being too small which was solved by sanding down the part.</description></item><item><title>Kicking things off, ordering parts, and 3D printing</title><link>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-1/</guid><description>Welcome! This is our first blog post out of many that will be coming over the next few months. We&amp;rsquo;ll be documenting our progress as we implement the designs we created last term for our automated sample preparation device, BioSpreadr. Included in the posts will be updates on the building, testing, and development of the project. We&amp;rsquo;ll document the major challenges we&amp;rsquo;re facing, significant breakthroughs that happen during development, and anything else that might be interesting!</description></item><item><title/><link>https://biospreadr.github.io/main/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biospreadr.github.io/main/</guid><description>test post</description></item></channel></rss>
