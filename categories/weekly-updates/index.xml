Orders were made from Digikey and McMaster-Carr due to their excellent selection and fulfillment.
Carrier Tube: Mechanical Assembly Work on the carrier tube began with the rental of a 3D printer from a friend. Took some time to get acquainted with the printer, specifically with calibrating the XYZ, leveling the bed, and fine-tuning the Z level of the extruder.</description></item></channel></rss>
