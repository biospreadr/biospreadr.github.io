The main components of our suction mechanism are an ultrasonic sensor, suction cup, vacuum pump, and tubing which is used to lift and replace the lid on the Petri dish. The suction cup and ultrasonic sensor need to be held in fixed positions by a plate so that detection, lifting, and replacing of the Petri dish lid can be accomplished effectively.</description></item><item><title>More progress on the Carrier Tube Mechanism</title><link>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-2/</guid><description>Week 4 Carrier Tube: Mechanical Updates After getting the initial prints completed last week, this week was spent refining the mechanics of the carrier tube system and testing everything prior to handoff for electrical/software integration. Initial test fits revealed that the solenoid cavity in the 3D printed part was too small to fit the solenoid. There was a similar problem last week with the inner carrier tube being too small which was solved by sanding down the part.</description></item><item><title>Kicking things off, ordering parts, and 3D printing</title><link>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://biospreadr.github.io/blog/post-1/</guid><description>Welcome! This is our first blog post out of many that will be coming over the next few months. We&amp;rsquo;ll be documenting our progress as we implement the designs we created last term for our automated sample preparation device, BioSpreadr. Included in the posts will be updates on the building, testing, and development of the project. We&amp;rsquo;ll document the major challenges we&amp;rsquo;re facing, significant breakthroughs that happen during development, and anything else that might be interesting!</description></item></channel></rss>
