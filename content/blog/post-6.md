# Week 8

This week we were focusing on getting each component of BioSpreadr into a more finalized state.

## Suction Mechanism

We were able to finish the first iteration of the suction mechanism ahead of schedule. This version was working well but to improve the precision and consitency of lifting the lid we added a linear guide. This modification made the mechanism more similar to what a production version of the system would look like. We also cleaned up the wiring from our first version of the mechanism. The following images show the updated wiring and the system with the new linear guide.

After adding the guide we recalibrated and tested the system. The specific method and controls for the suction mechanism had to be changed to account for the change from hand usage to linear guide. The following video demonstrates the suction mechanism with updated assembly and controls.

Some additional error handling was also added this week. Specfically, test cases for the suction cup being too far away, no lid on the Petri dish, failure to lift the lid, and dropping the lid were considered. The following videos demonstrate the 4 error cases.

* Dropping the lid: ![Error (4)](https://media.giphy.com/media/uZ4aKiluk4XUTkONo8/giphy.gif)


## Carrier Tube

After finalizing the electrical system for the carrier tube mechanism last week we focused on a mechanical assembly to mount the carrier tube. The following video shows the working mechanism in a fully assembled state.

## Mechanical Simulation

For mechanical simulation, we generated an exploded view animation and an animation of the system operating to demonstrate the updated CAD models for the system. These animations can be seen below.
