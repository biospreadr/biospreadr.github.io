# Week 9-12

Over the past few weeks we've finalized the physical prototypes for **BioSpreadr**. We've also developed an informative poster and marketing video to present **BioSpreadr** at the Univeristy of Waterloo final year design project symposium. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the symposium was held virtually this year. Despite this, we still had a great presentation where we were able to show off all the work we have done over the past two terms and to interact with audience members who had questions about **BioSpreadr**.
