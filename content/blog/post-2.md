# Week 4

## Carrier Tube: Mechanical Updates
After getting the initial prints completed last week, this week was spent refining the mechanics of the carrier tube system and testing everything prior to handoff for electrical/software integration. Initial test fits revealed that the solenoid cavity in the 3D printed part was too small to fit the solenoid. There was a similar problem last week with the inner carrier tube being too small which was solved by sanding down the part. Unfortunately, sanding down the solenoid was not an option.
 
Consequently, the main body of the carrier tube was re-printed at 103% scale, which ensured that there was enough clearance for all components without the need for post-print finishing. Once the reprint was complete, the whole mechanical system was put together and tested by hand. The completed system is shown below:

The photo shows the main body with the solenoid and piston inside, as well as the inlet and outlet bead feeding tubes installed. Manual operation showed that the system consistently dispenses the correct number of beads without jams or other malfunctions. This represents the achievement of a key design goal for the Biospreadr apparatus.
Next steps for the carrier tube include mechanizing the system by powering the solenoid and adding software control.
