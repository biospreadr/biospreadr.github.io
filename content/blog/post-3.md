## Suction Mechanism: Mechanical Updates

After receiving parts for the suction mechanism, mechanical assembly came first. The main components of our suction mechanism are an ultrasonic sensor, suction cup, vacuum pump, and tubing which is used to lift and replace the lid on the Petri dish. The suction cup and ultrasonic sensor need to be held in fixed positions by a plate so that detection, lifting, and replacing of the Petri dish lid can be accomplished effectively. The plate we're using was machined out of a larger piece of acrylic, which was the best option available despite being a little thick. The sensor bolts turned out to be shorter than expected so adding a countersink allowed each of them to be secured with nuts. Ideally, the bolts in the final product would be a bit longer to avoid this.
 
The plate thickness of about 0.5cm seems to be more than enough to support the components mounted to it, despite the decently heavy suction cup. The suction cup needed to be placed sufficiently off to the side so that it did not interfere with the sensor readings. The matching fitting was used as a reference for the hand tap size needed for the plate.

The plate with the sensor and suction cup attached can be seen below:
