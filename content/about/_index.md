Biomedical laboratories have lagged in their adoption of automation compared to other fields in the natural sciences.
Automation holds many benefits, chief among them increased efficiency and consistency.
The preparation of Petri dishes is an area ripe for automation, and few solutions currently exist.
Increased test volumes of 10-15\% per year make automation critical.

A more consistent and efficient method for performing the spread plate technique is required.
Our team was formed to develop a machine that would automate this process.
