This is our first blog post out of many that will be coming over the next few months. We&amp;rsquo;ll be documenting our progress as we implement the designs we created last term for our automated sample preparation device, BioSpreadr. Included in the posts will be updates on the building, testing, and development of the project. We&amp;rsquo;ll document the major challenges we&amp;rsquo;re facing, significant breakthroughs that happen during development, and anything else that might be interesting!</description></item></channel></rss>
